Welcome to SQL and Relational Database 101!

1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,620
Database software usage is pervasive.

2
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,590
Its presence is everywhere, from retrieving money through an automatic teller machine,

3
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,440
to badge access at a secure office location.

4
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:29,980
Yet it is basically taken for granted every day by billions of users worldwide.

5
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,580
In computer science, databases are among the most researched domains.

6
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:39,400
And, there are multiple types of databases to suit various industry requirements.

7
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:47,430
In this course, you'll learn the relational database model and the basics of the SQL language

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,390
through a series of components: There are five modules, covering an introduction to

9
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:00,589
relational databases (including definitions), information and data models, and relational

10
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:02,960
model constraints.

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,990
You are also introduced to five basic SQL statements, including some advanced techniques

12
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:14,490
in retrieving data from one or more relational database tables.

13
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,760
At the end of each module, there are three review questions to test your knowledge and

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,810
understanding of the concepts.

15
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:28,240
You'll also be able to apply what you've learned through four hands-on labs so you can try

16
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
out these concepts yourself.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,610
Then, you'll be ready to take the 15-question final exam!

18
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:40,180
From start to finish, this course should take you less than four hours.

19
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,900
And, as Spock said in the movie Wrath of Kahn, "For everything there is a first time".

20
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,969
So let's get started!
